# Jobsity challenge
To run this app you just need to download the project and unzip it.
Then use any type of command line and position yourself in the project folder, make sure you have node installed, and run the command "npm install". 
After that is finished, make sure you have RabbitMQ running and that the port 4000 is not taken.
Finally you can run the command "npm start".
If you go to the address "http://localhost:4000" in your browser, you will access the page. 
The available users are: 
Username: admin
password: admin.
And:
Username: admin1
password: admin1

PS
I'm aware that in the assets folder is the key to acces the firebase, but that's the way that google tells you to do in the documentation
